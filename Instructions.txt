Create and submit 3 files for this assignment:

- makefile
- gryphflix.c (all function definitions go here)
- main.c (has the main program to test all functions written in gryphflix.c)

Follow the instructions given in A1.pdf to submit these files to Gitlab (also given below for convenience).  

Step 1: Computer setup (local)
- make sure git is installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Mac users can use the terminal mode (I have tested it on my mac) 
- Windows users can use powershell,  WSL (windows subsystem for linux) or git bash.  
- decide where cis2500 work will go and make a directory (e.g. mkdir CIS2500)
- cd to that directory from the terminal application

Step 2: From the chosen directory, now type: 
git clone https://git.socs.uoguelph.ca/2500w21/<your username>/a1.git

At this point, you have a directory to work with on your local system.

Step 3: Do the work

- (remember to) cd to the new directory
- create the file that you are working on
- after first save, type:   git add filename
ONLY ADD THE FILE ONCE!!!   //do not do: git add .

Loop every 20-30 minutes:
    git commit -am "write something here about what you just did"

Once per day:
	git push   // this is what stores local work back to the server.
